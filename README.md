# Certificate-Based Approximation in Sobolev Spaces

This repository hosts the formal Coq development for certificate-driven approximation of functions in Sobolev spaces, as described in the appendices of our manuscript and in our patent-pending system. It implements fully constructive, machine-checkable algorithms for universal embedding and approximation, using local certificates, compatibility checks, and partition-of-unity gluing.

> 💡 **Goal:** Given a computable function `f` in a Sobolev space and accuracy `ε`, construct a finite certificate and a reproducible global approximant `f_ε`, with formal correctness guarantees.

## 🚧 Project Status

- **Initial release:** Contains all core Coq files underpinning our appendices and main results, including type definitions, certificate construction, partition-of-unity, error bounds, and explicit examples.
- **Ongoing development:** Modularization, addition of `Utils/` and `Examples/`, integration of numerical scripts and proof documents, and further expansion per our roadmap (see below).
- **Patent pending:** Key algorithmic and architectural methods in this repository are covered by U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/827,358, filed June 20, 2025. See the LICENSE and “Intellectual Property” section for important details on usage.
